Targeting strategies exist just for the purpose of gradual testing of new Page Level Tagging. Once the tests are complete this can probably be removed.

From Slack:
Nef is putting a new story for testing this:

1. For the untagged communities - just use it, as there is nothing to compare. Revenue increase is unclear due to various reasons, including the traffic nature on those communities (indirect).
2. Using page level tags for already (manually) tagged communities and measure against performance / revenue. For this existing taxonomy will be used.
3. Replay 2. with new taxonomy.

Epics for those 3 “tests”
